This document helps developers to get started to issue and accept payment messages on DASH blockchain.

The developer has to follow following steps

A-1) Developer-setup
- Developer creates two products BLUE011_Issuer, BLUE011_Consumer
- BLUE011 indicates the group to process message (Issuer and Consumer )
- In BLUE011_example_issuer_mobile sample provided, the developer enters the API-key 
- In BLUE011_example_consumer_mobile sample provided, the developer enters the API-key 

A-2) Developer implementing issue message

- Developer prepares issuing message (as in Developer-setup)
- Developer loads crypto-money from users-wallet into blockchain-address of message
- Developer can use this message in his features


A-3) Developer implementing consume message

- Developer prepares consuming message (as in Developer-setup)
- Developer accepts the message and PIN.
- Developer identifies to which account the crypto-money has to be credited.
-- It could be users-wallet address or developers-address
- Developer calls REST api to accept funds by passing proper parameters.
- Crypto-money will be credited to blockchain address provided
- Developer can display the crypto-money received

The user experience the developer can provide is as follows    

User experience in mobile wallet
B-1) User experience sending money as message
- User-A has a mobile wallet with "crypto money"
- User-A issues messages "in his mobile app" with a specific amount of money in that. It is protected by PIN
- User-A sends this message to User-B, by email or whatsapp.

B-2) User experience receiving money as message
- User-B accepts message "in his mobile app". 
- User-B enters PIN and accepts payment in his wallet.
- User-B receives crypto-money in his mobile wallet. 

User experience in ATM and mobile-wallet
B-1) User receiving payment as message in ATM instead of CASH
- User-A goes to ATM and enters amount of money(100$) to receive.
- ATM prints the Payment message in a coupon. It send PIN by SMS to User-A.

B-2) User experience spending the coupon in retail store.
- User-A submits the coupon to a retail store accepting DASH crypto
- Retail store scans the coupon, provided. 
- Retail store asks User-A enters PIN 
- The money in coupon is transfered to retail store
- The User-A has spent the coupon at retail store

To compare other payment mechanisms with above method
- Using standard Bitcoin, Dash, Litecoin, Bitcoincash the transfer has to be done directly to receivers blockchain-address.
- It cannot be sent as message
- It cannot be sent in email, whatsapp with flexibility
- Using ethereum, it requires maintenance of smart-contract
- Using stellar, ripple limitation is similar to bitcoin.
- Using hyperledger we are not sure.

The developer package needed to implement this is 
- BLUE011_Issuer
- BLUE011_Consumer

BLUE011_Issuer, helps in issuing payment messages.
BLUE011_Consumer, helps in consuming payment messages.

Notes:
1) These are one time use messages. It cannot be used and should not be used more than once, as data will be visible in public blockchain.

2) The PIN, Uid, Json data will be visible in public after transaction is executed.
3) The protection of PIN data will be available in other products.
